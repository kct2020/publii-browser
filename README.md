That link lets me run a browser in Gitpod, as per the conclusion of https://www.gitpod.io/blog/native-ui-with-vnc/. So I'm experimenting with that setup to see if I can install Publii. Because all my attempts to run the Linux install so far have failed - except [installing Publii on my own Chromebook](https://publii-book.pages.dev/welcome-to-publiibook/).

## Publii Linux Image Download
Branch gitpod-download. Necause I am in the habit of creating a branch for Gitpod.
